[Github](https://github.com/JEENB/Vehicle_Detection)

## Work Flow
`utils.py`: consist of utility functions such as visualizations, changing color space, and so on.    
`main.ipynb`: consists of all the necessary functions for vehicle detection.  
`conf_accuracy.py`: getting the accuracy score for different parameters. (Can be ignored)   
`test_images`: consists of two folders with different set of test images    
`project_video_result.mp4`: Final Video   

Note: Since the training dataset are huge, the folders are not uploaded to gitHub. Please download the same using the linke provided in the jupyter notebook.
